## About

A simple git tool for documenting and dicovering multi-repo projects.

You can do the following things with `gitdig`:

- Collect the most important information about the git repositories into a json or yaml file,
  for further processing.
- Collect package info via downloading package.json (pom.xml, or other package file)
- List and Check repositories via predefined rules, and print problems to the console.

In order to learn more about how to install and use the tool, read the [Get Started](getStarted.html) page, then continue with reading the [documentation](documentation.html).
